# Server Setup

Start the server by using the command run main.go in the server_setup directory.
It will start a server listening at http://localhost:8080/.
The endpoint to get the list of products is http://localhost:8080/products. 

TODO: add distinct image url for each product.

# Calling the server

A short code to see how we can call this API to get the list of products.
The idea is that this code should be merged within the frontend part.
